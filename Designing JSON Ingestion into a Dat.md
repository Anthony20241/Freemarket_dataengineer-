1. Designing JSON Ingestion into a Data Lake (Bronze > Silver > Gold Layers)

Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion):

Ingest raw JSON as-is using streaming (e.g., Kafka) or batch uploads into a Data Lake (e.g., S3).
Store in partitioned folders by date (e.g., year/month/day).
Use Delta Lake for a table with minimal schema, preserving original structure.
Add metadata (e.g., ingestion timestamp, source file) for traceability.


Silver Layer (Cleansing and Normalization):

Read from Bronze, parse JSON with a defined schema, and flatten nested fields (e.g., PartnerBankA.Appetite).
Handle arrays (e.g., Reasons) by exploding into rows or keeping as arrays.
Apply data quality checks (nulls, duplicates, type validation).
Store as Delta tables, partitioned by client ID or date for efficient queries.


Gold Layer (Aggregation and Business-Ready Data):

Aggregate data (e.g., average credit score, count unique reasons).
Denormalize or enrich with external data for analytics.
Create optimized tables or views for BI tools, using partitioning or Z-ordering.
Expose for reporting/ML via SQL endpoints or data warehouses.


Pipeline Orchestration:

Chain Bronze > Silver > Gold with a workflow tool (e.g., Airflow).
Monitor for failures, latency, and data drift.



2. Handling Changes to Nests and Field Names

Schema Evolution:

Use Delta Lake’s schema merging to add new fields without data loss.
Keep Bronze schemaless, inferring schemas dynamically.


Dynamic Parsing:

Parse JSON flexibly without hard-coded schemas.
Use mapping tables for field renames, updated via CI/CD.


Versioning and Backfills:

Leverage Delta’s time-travel for reprocessing with updated logic.
Create parallel tables for major changes, migrating gradually.


Data Quality:

Detect schema drift with validation tools.
Use feature flags to toggle old/new parsing logic.



This ensures a scalable, flexible ingestion pipeline resilient to schema changes.
